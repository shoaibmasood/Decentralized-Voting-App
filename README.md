# Decentralized Voting System Using Ethereum Blockchain

This repository contains the code and documentation for a decentralized voting system that leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to ensure voter anonymity, verifiability, and auditability, addressing issues such as voter fraud and lack of transparency.

## Abstract

The integration of blockchain technology with voting systems addresses key issues in traditional voting, such as voter fraud, ballot manipulation, and lack of trust. This project explores how blockchainâ€™s immutability, decentralization, and transparency can provide a secure, tamper-proof voting system. Two research questions drive this investigation: ensuring anonymity, verifiability, and auditability, and exploring how smart contracts can establish transparent and tamper-resistant voting procedures.

The decentralized voting mechanism built on Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS focuses on privacy, transparency, and auditability. It includes a reset function to restart elections without contract redeployment. The system was rigorously tested for security and transparency, providing insights into future blockchain-based voting systems.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a decentralized voting system with the following key features:
- **Secure Voting**: Smart contracts enforce secure voting, ensuring only eligible voters can participate.
- **Scalability and Privacy**: IPFS is integrated for private data storage, improving scalability and security.
- **Reset Mechanism**: A reset mechanism allows elections to be managed flexibly without redeploying the smart contract.
- **Auditability and Transparency**: Ensures data immutability while enabling audits of the voting process.

## Features

- **Voter Anonymity**: Voter privacy is protected throughout the voting process.
- **Verifiability**: Votes are verifiable, ensuring integrity.
- **Auditability**: The election process is fully auditable, allowing verification of results.
- **Reset Mechanism**: Administrators can reset the election without redeploying contracts.
